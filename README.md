# journalism_events_shinyapp
This repository contains the code and data for a Shiny app aimed at providing an overview of journalism conferences, events and awards happening between late 2021 and 2023.  The dataset was built by using an API to look at the first 150 results of a couple of Google search queries, like "journalism conferences 2021" or "journalism award ceremonies".  The app is live on my website "Computational Social Journalism": http://compscjournalism.org/projects/journo_events/journo_events.html  It can also be explored here: https://simonabisiani.shinyapps.io/conferences_map/  The data is far from complete, as events are created and announced continuously. Do you know of any missing journalism industry-related event? Get in touch with a link, or the event name, and I will happily add it to the database :) Do you have suggestions on how to improve the app? I would love to hear your feedback!
